# Meteor Constantiam

Addon for meteor that implements Constantiam-specific modules.

## Features

- Const Elytra Boost from `mankool0`'s meteor fork (Initially from BleachHack) (fall mode worked until 2022-12-28, currently useless)
- Auto Elytra Speed: automatically switches speed of meteor's elytra fly in "new" chunks

## Versions

There is a release for 1.19.2 and dev builds for 1.19.3

I will not backport features to 1.19.2
